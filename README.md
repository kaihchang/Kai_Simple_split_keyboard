Kai Simple is a Sweep variation that fits author's hand best.
Author's first KB design: https://github.com/kaihchang/Ascend_splay_split_keyboard

I've been using my last Ascend KB for a month, while it is comfortable, MX switches are still relatively big and wide. Maybe it's bc I have a small hand or was used to Sweep before it, I started missing Chocs, so that's why there's this Simple.
Originally I designed Simple with the shortest (12mm) EC11 knobs I can find, but didn't like the look and figured that I don't really need knobs, and without them I can also skip diodes and make the build cleaner, so I went for 1 pin for each switch.
MCUs face up for englmaxi's ZMK on-board LED widget.
I'll probably stick with ZMK but just in case something went wrong with the power circuits (unlikely), I left a pin for TRRS connectors.
